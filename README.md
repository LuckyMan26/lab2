Program functionality:
1)Vizualization of sorting algorithms
1.1 Bubble sort
1.2 Insertion sort
1.3 QuickSort
1.4 Merge Sort
2)Vizualization of linked-list(basic operations: delete,search,insert)
3)You can stop your program while it is running and break algorithms into steps 
4)You can increase or decrease speed of algorithms`s vizualization.

Here is examples of work of my program.

It is very first version of project. Basically, I want to modify it. For instance, add Aho-Corasick, Boyere-Moore, KMP algorithms and make UI more convenient and user-friendly
